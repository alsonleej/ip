## Data Storage

### File Location
Kip stores all your tasks in a CSV file located at:
```
src/main/java/kip/storage/tasks.csv
```

### File Format
The CSV file uses the following format:
```csv
type,done,description,datetime1,datetime2
T,0,buy groceries,,
D,1,submit report,2025-01-15 1800,
E,0,team meeting,2025-01-20 1400,2025-01-20 1600
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- **type**: T (ToDo), D (Deadline), or E (Event)
- **done**: 0 (false) or 1 (true)
- **description**: Task description
- **datetime1**: Deadline date or event start time
- **datetime2**: Event end time (unused for ToDo/Deadline)

### Data Persistence
- Tasks are automatically saved after every modification
- No manual saving is required
- Data persists between application sessions
- The file is created automatically if it doesn't exist

---

## Date and Time Formats

Kip supports two date/time formats:

### Date Only Format
**Format:** `yyyy-MM-dd`

**Examples:**
- `2025-01-15` (January 15, 2025)
- `2025-12-31` (December 31, 2025)

### Date and Time Format
**Format:** `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm`

**Examples:**
- `2025-01-15 1800` (January 15, 2025 at 6:00 PM)
- `2025-12-31 2359` (December 31, 2025 at 11:59 PM)

### Important Notes
- **24-hour format**: Times are in 24-hour format (00:00 to 23:59)
- **No commas**: Task descriptions and dates cannot contain commas (,) as they break the CSV format
- **Leading zeros**: Use leading zeros for single-digit months and days

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Invalid task number!" Error
**Problem:** You're trying to mark, unmark, or delete a task that doesn't exist.

**Solution:** 
- Use `list` to see all available tasks
- Use the correct task number from the list
- Task numbers start from 1

#### "Invalid date format" Error
**Problem:** The date you provided doesn't match the supported formats.

**Solution:**
- Use `yyyy-MM-dd` for dates only (e.g., `2025-01-15`)
- Use `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm` for dates with time (e.g., `2025-01-15 1800`)
- Ensure you're using 24-hour format for times

#### "Cannot contain commas" Error
**Problem:** Your task description or date contains commas.

**Solution:**
- Remove commas from task descriptions
- Use different characters instead of commas
- Commas are reserved for CSV formatting

#### "No matching tasks found" Message
**Problem:** Your search keyword doesn't match any task descriptions.

**Solution:**
- Check your spelling
- Try a different keyword
- Use partial words (e.g., "meet" instead of "meeting")

### File Access Issues

#### "Error creating/saving tasks.csv" Message
**Problem:** Kip cannot access the storage file.

**Solution:**
- Ensure you have write permissions in the application directory
- Check if the file is being used by another program
- Restart the application

## FAQ

### Q: Can I edit a task after creating it?
A: Currently, Kip doesn't support editing tasks directly. You can delete the task and create a new one with the correct information.

### Q: How many tasks can I store?
A: There's no hard limit on the number of tasks. However, very large lists may take longer to load and save.

### Q: Can I use Kip on different operating systems?
A: Yes! Kip is a Java application and runs on any system with Java 17 or higher installed.

### Q: What happens if I close Kip without typing 'bye'?
A: Your tasks are automatically saved after every command, so you won't lose any data. However, it's good practice to use the `bye` command to exit properly.

### Q: Can I backup my tasks?
A: Yes! Simply copy the `tasks.csv` file to create a backup. You can restore it by replacing the file and restarting Kip.

### Q: Why can't I use commas in task descriptions?
A: Commas are used as separators in the CSV file format. Using commas would break the file structure and cause data corruption.

### Q: Can I change the date format?
A: Currently, Kip only supports the `yyyy-MM-dd` and `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm` formats. This ensures consistency and prevents parsing errors.
